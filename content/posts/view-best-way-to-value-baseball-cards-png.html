                The best way to get an idea of a card&#039;s value is go to beckett.com. I am a top rated seller so i have to use tracking on each item i sell and ship so i would be loosing money if i did free shipping on a 0.99 card. I buy and sell baseball cards and have since 1989.

    <h3>There&#039;s nothing on the card but if you&#039;re not familiar with the product or sports cards in general, this is a good confirmation.</h3>
    <p>The aim is to provide factual information from the marketplace to help collectors. Is it best to sell them in lots of the same player or individually? The best way to get an idea of a card&#039;s value is go to beckett.com. That&#039;s not always the case but it&#039;s certainly the card i have isn&#039;t a mini.</p>
