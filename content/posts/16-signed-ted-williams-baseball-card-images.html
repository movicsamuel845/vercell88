    <p>The 1954 wilson franks ted williams puts the two together with a baseball card spin. I&#039;m giving 2 stars because the seller did refund me, but he should have never sold this card as an original 1956 topps card. Not sure of where you live, but if there are card shows nearby where psa are on location, it would be well worth it to get them to authenticate it. Great savings &amp; free delivery / collection on many items.</p>
